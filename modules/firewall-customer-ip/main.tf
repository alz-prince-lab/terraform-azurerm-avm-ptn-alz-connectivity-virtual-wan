      # considered choice (option (b) of an (a)/(b) reconsideration), not an oversight.
      #
      # An earlier revision of this module (commit `af77839`, since reverted) added a client-side
      # `natGateway == null` check after finding that a NAT-Gateway-attached public IP presents
      # `ipConfiguration = null` while `natGateway` is non-null, and would otherwise be silently treated
      # as unowned. That diagnosis is correct and remains true. The decision to check for it client-side
      # was reversed after the parent directly tested the exact previously-unverified path: a live ARM PUT
      # attaching a NAT-Gateway-owned public IP as a THIRD ipConfiguration on this module's own live
      # secured-hub firewall (`Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls`, api-version 2024-10-01). Azure rejected
      # it with a synchronous `400 PublicIPAddressInUse` in ~5 seconds, naming the exact conflicting
      # `natGateways/...` resource ID and the offending ipConfiguration, BEFORE any mutation - the firewall
      # was left `Succeeded` with its prior ipConfigurations unchanged, no orphaned config, no partial
      # state, no takeover of the NAT gateway's IP.
      #
      # Given that measured result, a client-side natGateway check adds no safety this exact attach path
      # doesn't already provide, and Azure's own rejection is strictly MORE informative than anything this
      # precondition could produce (it names the actual owning resource; this precondition can only ever
      # say "in use by a NAT Gateway" or "in use by another resource"). A natGateway-only client-side check
      # would also cover exactly one of several possible non-`ipConfiguration` association surfaces on
      # this resource type, while implying a completeness it does not have for any other surface that
      # might exist outside the schema fields this module reads - the same "verified free" false-confidence
      # failure mode this session has flagged elsewhere. `ipConfiguration` itself is deliberately still
      # checked below (unrelated to the natGateway question): it is a pre-existing, unrelated guard, and it
      # remains schema-generic across every consumer type that attaches via that field (NIC, Load Balancer
      # frontend, Application Gateway frontend, VPN/ExpressRoute Gateway, Bastion, Route Server, and
      # NIC-attached APIM/VMSS - confirmed via the ARM template reference for this API version).
      #
      # Ownership by NAT Gateway (or any other surface not reflected in `ipConfiguration`) is therefore an
      # explicitly accepted, documented prerequisite, not a client-side-enforced one: the caller must supply
      # a public IP that is not attached elsewhere, and Azure's own control plane is the authoritative,
      # synchronous, pre-mutation enforcement of that prerequisite for the firewall-attach path specifically
