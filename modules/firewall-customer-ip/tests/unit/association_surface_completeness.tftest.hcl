# RELEASE QUALIFICATION EVIDENCE (issue #352 offline review) - NOT a new fix. These runs are all GREEN
# against both the pre- and post-nat_gateway-fix implementation; they exist purely to substantiate, with
# concrete citations, the completeness claim made in the release qualification report about the ownership
# precondition in main.tf.
#
# Per Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses@2024-10-01 (this module's default API version - see variables.tf
# and the ARM template reference at learn.microsoft.com/azure/templates/microsoft.network/2024-10-01/
# publicipaddresses), `PublicIPAddressPropertiesFormat` exposes exactly two top-level properties that
# indicate the IP is attached to another Azure resource:
#   - `ipConfiguration` (response-only; a `{id: string}` reference) - populated identically regardless of
#     which *type* of resource owns the referenced IP configuration: a network interface, a Load Balancer
#     frontend IP configuration, an Application Gateway frontend IP configuration, a VPN/ExpressRoute
#     Gateway IP configuration, an Azure Bastion IP configuration, a Route Server IP configuration, or a
#     NIC-attached API Management/VMSS instance. Azure does not expose a distinct field per consumer type;
#     they all funnel through this single, generic reference.
#   - `natGateway` (a `{id: string}` reference) - the one consumer type that does NOT use an IP
#     configuration and therefore needed its own dedicated check (added in this session's authorized fix;
#     see nat_gateway_ownership_gap.tftest.hcl).
# There is no separate `natRule`/`natRules` or `loadBalancerBackendAddressPools` property directly on this
# resource at this API version - confirmed via the same ARM template reference.
#
# Because `main.tf`'s ownership precondition already rejects ANY non-null `ipConfiguration` that does not
# parse as *this exact firewall's* own ipConfiguration (see `local.public_ip_association_parents` in
# locals.tf, and the pre-existing `reject_non_firewall_association` run in prerequisites.tftest.hcl, which
# already proved this for a network-interface-shaped association), the check is generic across resource
# *type* - it was never NIC-specific. The runs below simply substitute a Load Balancer frontend IP
# configuration and an Application Gateway frontend IP configuration in place of the NIC shape already
# tested, to make that genericity concrete for two more of the specific surfaces named in the release
# qualification follow-up (Load Balancer frontend/backend attachment, Application Gateway attachment).
# Azure Bastion, Route Server, VPN/ExpressRoute Gateway, and VMSS/API-Management-via-NIC all present the
# same `.../<resourceType>/<name>/ipConfigurations/<name>`-shaped association value and are covered by the
# identical code path - they are not re-enumerated here to avoid redundant, purely-cosmetic test runs
# against one already-generic code path.
#
# Explicitly NOT covered by this check, and not claimed to be: `linkedPublicIPAddress` (dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
# sibling PIP reference) and `servicePublicIPAddress` (Basic-to-Standard migration sibling PIP reference).
# Both exist on this same schema but represent a PIP-to-PIP relationship, not "in use by a consuming network
# resource" - checking them was out of this fix's authorized scope, and doing so speculatively risks
# rejecting legitimate configurations (e.g. a customer deliberately supplying both halves of a dual-stack
# pair). This exclusion is called out explicitly in the release qualification report rather than left
# silently unstated.
