# but exercised directly against this leaf module's own character-identical precondition on
# azapi_resource.this (see main.tf's decision-record comment on that precondition). A pre-existing
# customer-mode firewall's real ipConfigurations response is a heterogeneous, unification-impossible tuple
# (one element carries privateIPAddress as a string, the other omits that key entirely - real ARM
# key-omission, not null). Before the fix, coalesce()-based misclassification silently read this genuine
# customer-mode firewall as managed, and this precondition wrongly rejected an ordinary same-mode grow
# (adding a third customer IP).
