# RELEASE QUALIFICATION PROBE (issue #352 offline review) - documents current behavior only.
#
# The only zone-related precondition on azapi_resource.this (see main.tf) is:
#
#   condition = length(coalesce(var.zones, [])) == 0 ? true : alltrue([
#     for ip in data.azapi_resource.public_ips : length(try(coalesce(ip.output.zones, []), [])) > 0
#   ])
#
# This checks only that each customer public IP has a NON-EMPTY zones list whenever the firewall is
# zone-redundant (var.zones non-empty). It never compares the IP's actual zone SET against var.zones. A
# firewall configured with zones = ["1", "2", "3"] therefore currently accepts a customer public IP whose
# zones are only ["1"], or even a disjoint set such as ["2"], as long as the list is non-empty.
#
# This test deliberately does NOT assert that Azure itself would accept a mismatched/disjoint zone set at
# apply time - that is a live-Azure question this offline suite cannot answer and is flagged separately as a
# missing live gate in the release qualification report. This test only pins down and documents the
# module's own current plan/apply-time acceptance behavior so a future change to the precondition is a
# visible, deliberate decision instead of a silent regression.
